# Would You Rather Project

As part of Udacity's React Program(https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019), we were tasked to create a game based off of "Would You Rather". The rules of the game are; A user is asked a question in the form: “Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?”. Answering "neither" or "both" is against the rules. Users will be able to answer questions, see which questions they haven’t answered, see how other people have voted, post questions, and see the ranking of users on the leaderboard.

The project was developed using React and Redux, which significance placed on Redux usage. No data is persisted outside the current state of Redux, so refreshing the webpage will wipe the data.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Installing

Clone the repo

```
git clone https://github.com/julio-lockhart/Would-You-Rather.git
```

Change into the _would-you-rather_ project directory

```
cd would-you-rather
```

Install project dependencies

```
npm install
```

And start the application

```
npm start
```

The project app will then automatically launch in your browser.

## Backend Server

A backend server was given to us that provided the following operations (file can found in: [`_DATA_.js`](src/utils/_DATA_.js)):

## Data
